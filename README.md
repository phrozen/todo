Minimalistic sample To Do app with Go backend and AlpineJS frontend.

It is a very simple app for new developers that aims to be as simple as possible (yet full featured) and simplifies the process of showing how REST JSON APIs work in a client-server architecture. The Go server backend embeds and serves a single HTML file with the full frontend application, all CSS/JS libraries are loaded from [JSDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN.

+ [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) As the backend web server framework
+ [GORM](https://gorm.io/) For database handling
+ [AlpineJS](http://alpinejs.dev/) As the frontend JS reactive framework
+ [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) As a minimalist CSS style framework for (almost) classless design
+ [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) To display due date in a more human readable fashion
